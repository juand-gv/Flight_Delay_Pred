# ML with PySpark: Predicting flight delays

This repo contains an interesting exercise related to ML with PySpark. The exercise is based from 
the [RASHID60's notebook ](https://www.kaggle.com/rashid60) and was copied for learning purposes.

You can find the Notebook in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/rashid60/ml-with-pyspark-predicting-flight-delays


### The goal of this project is to create a system that predicts flight delays using an airline dataset. Spark can be used to perform predictive and descriptive analysis on large datasets and handle big data from the airline industry with accuracy.
